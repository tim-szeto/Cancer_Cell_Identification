# Identifying Malignant Breast Cancer Cells
Early detection of cancerous growths through regular health check ups, screening programmes and/or routine self assessments, is vital for favourable prognosis.<br>
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK<sup>__[1](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/breast-cancer)__</sup>.<br>
Survival is generally good due to early detection programmes and awareness. It is more common in females than males with multiple contributing risk factors including age, familial history (_i.e._, genetics), and lifestyle (_e.g._, obesity, smoking).<br>

This project aims to train and evaluate a suite of machine learning algorithms (classification and clustering) to distinguish the difference between benign and malignant breast cells given morphology measurements.<br>
